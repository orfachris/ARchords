# ARchords
Augmented Reality Application for Guitar Learning in Mobile Devices

## Description
Its main function is to visualize the guitar chords with the use of three-dimensional (3D) 
models that enrich the real world, achieving the ability to view from different angles 
and consequently the transmission of information that can not be captured in print 
media. In addition, the application enables the reproduction of videotaped material of 
study exercises and provides two important tools, a digital tuner and a digital 
metronome. Its goal is to provide useful functions that make the guitar learning an 
easier process in combination with traditional learning tools (books).
